# Monitar

![FlyffBanner](https://fontawesome.com/social/bell-on?f=&s=)

Monitar is an uptime monitoring tool designed specifically for Windows applications. Its primary purpose is to continuously monitor the status of selected applications, alerting users in real-time via NTFY notifications if any monitored application becomes unresponsive or unexpectedly shuts down. With Monitar, users can ensure the uninterrupted operation of critical applications, making it ideal for environments where high availability is essential. The tool not only tracks uptime but also offers configurable monitoring intervals, customizable alerts, and detailed logs to support proactive management and troubleshooting.

## Installation

As of now, there's no build release for Monitar yet but you can build it from the source. To do it, you just need to execute the Windows Batch file.

```
./build.cmd
```
This will create a `dist` directory. This is where you'll see the built executable. Before you make all these, make sure that you have Python 3 installed in your device.
